# Formula
The personal culture was determined by finding the weighted average of how long you've eached in each country, averaged out by your parents. After that, I did the euclidian distance to find how culturally close you are to each country.

# Future Updates
I need to make some updates for if your parents are also TCKS, if you only have 1 parent, and make the UI a little nicer.
